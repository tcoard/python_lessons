The code written in this tutorial might not be the "best" way to accomplish a task.
But my main goal is to not teach the one correct way to solve a problem, but to add more tools to your toolbelt.

Some of the features I am sharing will only work in python 3.9 or newer, but there are other ways of using these features in older versions of python 3.

# debugging
show debugging.py
run with error
look in other other
put in breakpoint
print values
run again and step into first function

add breakpoint at end to show continue
to show until, add a bunch of e's and make a for loop looking for t

# the rest
[1, 2, 3, 8, 9]
loop
new function
list comprehension
map
zip (with old function)
tangent: dictionary comprehension
return first result with break
what if divide evens takes a long time?
* we could add break and comparison in mass function
* use map
* use yield
what if we want the largest number post division
show normal max
show lambda (add one)
show max lambda %8
show filter lambda %2 (evens)
(have them think about how to solve this) show max %8 filter %2
context manager

decorators (difficult to write, great to use!)
cache add multiple 1's to nums

dataclass with student
sort students by grade (min with lambda)

extra time: partial type hints
